# Cerberus
A LWJGL game made in spring of 2016

Y.O.U.N.G Invaders II (working title Project Cerberus) is a 2-D top down 
forward-scrolling space shooter inspired by galaga. Cerberus is written in 
Java 8 using LWJGL 2.9.3 (with some library code from older LWJGL 2.0) and 
SlickUtil. Development of Cerberus lasted about 2 weeks, the first being 
devoted to building a game engine and the second for writing game mechanics, 
enemy AI, graphical design, etc.

This project was coded by Henry Du and Alex Kim, with graphical art by Henry 
Du and Albert Tai.
